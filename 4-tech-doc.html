		Born the son of Jerome Wade in Killavally, Westmeath in Ireland, Wade was commissioned into the Earl of Bath's Regiment on 26 December 1690 and served in Flanders in 1692, fighting at the Battle of Steenkerque in August 1692 during the Nine Years' War and earning a promotion to lieutenant on 10 February 1693. He transferred to Sir Bevil Granville's Regiment on 19 April 1694 and was promoted to captain on 13 June 1695.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the War of the Spanish Succession he first served under Marlborough, seeing action in Flanders at the Battle of Kaiserwerth in April 1702, the Battle of Venlo in September 1702, the Battle of Roermond in October 1702 and Battle of Liège also in October 1702. He was promoted to major on 20 March 1703 and to lieutenant colonel in October 1703. In 1704 he joined the staff of Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway as adjutant-general in Portugal, and distinguished himself as colonel of the Huntingdon's Regiment during the Battle of Alcántara during which he was wounded in April 1706. He repelled a large force of cavalry at Vila Nova and then commanded the 3rd infantry brigade during the Battle of Almansa in April 1707. He won promotion to brigadier general on 1 January 1708.

		Wade also organised a militia named "Highland Watches", calling on members of the landed gentry to sign up and raising the first six companies in 1725 (three of Campbells and one each of Frasers, Grants, and Munros). Also in 1725, Wade put down an insurrection after the government attempted to extend the "malt tax" to Scotland and enraged citizens in Glasgow drove out the military and destroyed the home of their representative in Parliament. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 15 April 1727.
	</p>
	<p>
		He raised four more "Highland Watch" companies in 1739; these were subsequently reorganized as the Black Watch regiment. He still had the time to sign his support to the Foundling Hospital which was established in 1739 in London. On 22 June 1742 he was appointed Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance and on 24 June 1742 he was appointed a member of the Privy Council.

		On 17 December 1743 he became a field marshal with his appointment to the joint command of the Anglo-Austrian force in Flanders against the French in the War of the Austrian Succession. Wade organised an advance towards Lille in July 1744 but the action became stalled in the face of logistical problems. He resigned from his command in March 1745, returning home to become Commander-in-Chief of the Forces.

		It was because of the difficulties Wade encountered marching his troops cross-country from Newcastle to Carlisle, that he built his Military Road west of Newcastle in 1746, entailing such destruction of Hadrian's Wall. Wade helped plan the road, but had died before construction began in 1751. His Military Road is still in use today as the B6318; it should not be confused with the Military Way built by the Romans immediately south of Hadrian's Wall.

		Wade received mention in a verse sung as part of God Save the King around 1745:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Lord, grant that Marshal Wade
		</li>
		<li>
			May, by thy mighty aid,
		</li>
		<li>
			Victory bring.
		</li>
		<li>
			May he sedition hush
		</li>
		<li>
			And, like a torrent, rush
		</li>
		<li>
			Rebellious Scots to crush.
		</li>
		<li>
			God save the King.
		</li>
	</ul>
