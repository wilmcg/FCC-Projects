    <h3 id="headline">Here is a time line of The D:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>1960</strong> - Kyle Gass is created in a lab when two junior scientists accidentally cross the genes of Jimmy Page with a russet potato</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1969</strong> - Jack Black is birthed by two demons mating under the stage at the Woodstock Festival while Jimi Hendrix plays the National Anthem
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1973</strong> - Kyle breaks out of the laboratory in a Hulk-esque rage, earning his nickname, "Rage Kage"
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1974</strong> - Jack uses his demon mind powers to summon one thousand bulls to attack an ice cream merchant who was out of Cookies 'n' Cream. From this, he earned his pseudonym, "J-Bulls." <em>Often stylized "Jables"</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1986</strong> - The two rockers meet for the first time in The Actors' Gang theater troupe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1986-present</strong> - There's no reason to fill in this part. Tenacious D is the greatest and best band in the world, and you undoubtedly know of their endless accomplishments and perfection in every field of the arts and beyond. They have definitely never created a box office bomb. All their movie attempts amassed instant critical acclaim. I don't know why you're still reading this. Go away. 
      </li>
    </ul>
